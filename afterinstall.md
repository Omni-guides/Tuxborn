### <ins>Post install instructions</ins>

If everthing went as planned you should now have a succesvol install of Tuxborn on you device, but you aren't done yet there are a couple of things you need to know before we can let you go.

Skyrim is a game that is great for modding but isn't know for it's stabiliet or being over all well made under the hood, we do a lot to reduce any issues related to this but there is still some important limmitations you need to know about. 

**Fps:** Skyrim runs a lot of stuff in the background, to make sure that is happing corectly the game needs to run @ 30fps without the use of framegen.

**Saving:** Skyrim saving system is kind of bad and it's quite easy to break, so make sure to only save when it's save to do so. Don't save during or direclty after ending combat, when a lot is happing, just after a loading screen or when you fps is below 30 and no auto saves. Do try to save regulary around every 20-40 min is good target, quicksave key make regulare saves now and never save scum.    

**Something not happing:** Sometime the game trips over it self and nothing happens, if that happens the first thing you should try is reloading a save and trying again. If that doesn't work check here: .

**Quiting and loading saves:** Skyrim has the bad issue of not properly closing stuff running in the background, here is what you need to know. Don't use quit to menu, always go to desktop. Don't try to load save file to main times in game.

Lastly Tuxborn is a curated modlist, there are things we set-up for you to tweak more on that here: , but if you want to add you own stuff or tweak settings not include in here you are going on your own road and means you won't get any support. We do have some information for you to help make that journey as smooth as possibel here: . Any queation related to this topic go in modlist-modifaction.

### <ins>In game</ins>

Tuxborn makes use of the [Alternate Start - Life another life SSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/272) mod - this allows you to select an alternative location or settings to start your journey. **We have deliberately removed some of the alternate start options as they proved to be buggy or cause issues further into a save.**

After making your Character, PLEASE WAIT until there are no longer any notification messages show in the top-left of the screen.

When no more messages are displayed (the final message should be "Museum List Build Complete", and does take quite a while to appear, but this only needs to happen once), pick up the book on the table, and then speak to the statue and select your Alternative Start, then sleep in the bed as directed to being your adventure!
