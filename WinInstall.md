Always include you newest wabbajack log in the post, you can find that in Wabbajack/X.X.X.X/logs. Before you do that just try to run wabba again and log in to your nexus acount again, some mods are know the fail downloading you can find links for them here: LINK.

Prepping your install of Skyrim  

### <ins>Windows</ins>

On your Windows system, install [Visual C++ x64](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) & [.Net Runtime v5desktop x64](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0/runtime) – these are required to run Wabbajack.

Download the Wabbajack application from [here](https://www.wabbajack.org/) and place it in a folder such as C:\Games\Wabbajack – Do not place it in Program Files, Downloads, or on your Desktop.

Make two folders, one you want to install Tuxborn to and one you are going to use for the downloads - do not select a directory in Downloads, Program Files or on the Desktop - use something like C:\Games\Tuxborn instead. The install folder and downloads don't have to be on the same drive.    

After that open windows settings, go to Privacy & security -> Windows Security -> Virus & threat protection -> manage settings below Settings for virus -> scroll down to expemtions. Add one for both folder you made in the last step, your skyrim install folder and the wabbajack.exe. If you use another ant-virus you will need to look on how to this in that program instead.

Open wabbajack with the exe you download and click the Cog icon in the bottum left of Wabbajack, then 'login' next to the Nexus Mods button and enter your Nexusmods account details.

Click Browse lists, make sure non-featured is sellected and use the search to look for Tuxborn. Then click on download and install, select were relevant the folders you made before.

Once ready, click the Play button in Wabbajack to begin the Wabbajack process.

Downloading any Wabbajack Modlist can take a while - how quickly it completes will depend on the speed of your internet connection and processing power of your PC.

When wabbajack has done it's thing also do the same windows settings you did before to the modorganisation.exe that is now in the install folder you used for Tuxborn.

### <ins>Page File Configuration</ins>

This step isn't stricly nessary but kan help with stabilty, by adding a ram overflow.

Press Windows + R and copy past sysdm.cpl ,3 in there, click ok.

Go to advanced -> settings -> advanced -> virtual memory -> custom size and set a page file of 20000 on you fastest drive

### <ins>How to start Tuxborn</ins>

# Starting the Game


**Steam Deck Users:** If you plan to use one of the BFCO profiles, due to a clash between RaceMenu, Steam Input and Bethesda "helping", you will need to add `SteamDeck=0 %command%` to the launch options in Steam:

You should also temporarily map the 'R' key so that you can initiate the Character Naming pop-up during character creation. You could for example map it to one of the back buttons using Steam Input configuration. This is only needed for Character Creation. You can thank Todd for this requirement.

### <ins>Profiles</ins>

There are six MO2 Profiles to choose from. Select the profile you want to use in the top left of MO2. For more info on them look here: LINK.

To start the Tuxborn, make sure “Tuxborn” is selected in the top right, and then click Play! But keep reading before you do.
