# Contributions
Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project.

As it stands, please file an Issue describing typos or other small errors with the content of the ReadMe, rather than creating a Pull Request.
If the Pull Request is for a minor change, I will make the change in the wiki/readme and close the Pull Request without merging.

# Issues
If you have a problem getting Tuxborn to run after following the installation guide (or running the automation script), then please create an Issue, or stop by the linked Discord channel to discuss.

Please include as much detail as you can, including screenshots, a description of the issue, whether it is repeatable or not, and if you are using the automated install script, a copy of the log from /home/<user>/omni-guides-sh.log (e.g. /home/deck/omni-guides-sh.log).
