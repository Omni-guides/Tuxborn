# Emissaries of Tux

Emissaries of Tux is a performance friendly Wabbajack list for the steam version of Enderal SE, aiming to give the world of Vyn a more unique feel over skyrim, targething at minimum the hardware of the Steamdeck. The list has optional modern combat and ego, plus some custom overhauls for Enemies and armor.

For those unfamiliar with Enderal, it’s a total overhaul for Skyrim made by the German game studio SureAI. It’s the 4 games in the setting of Vyn, but you don’t need to play the last 3 to get into Enderal. Depending on who you ask, it might even be better to jump in blind. Not only have the world and story be reworked but also the gameplay. Enderal world is deleved and you will need to buy skill books to level up your skills. Healing in combat comes with some minor drawbacks, similar to the rad system of Fallout, but there are also many powerful items to find around the world. While you sometimes will have to come back to stuff later with a more powerful character, there is always a way to overcome what you encounter. 

[EGO SE - Enderal Gameplay Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/enderalspecialedition/mods/3) builds on top of the systems in a similar way as the Skyrim mod Requiem does, all a lot of systems are more in depth but also more challenging. [BFCO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/117052) replaces the combat of Skyrim with a more modern feel, similar to what you see in Action RPGs released today. These are not for everybody and can be turn off by the end user if they want.

### <ins>Performance</ins>

As noted above, Emissaries of Tux is designed for the performance profile of the Steam Deck, but that doesn’t mean it’s limited to that platform! It’s also a great, content-full, lightweight (in terms of performance) list for less powerful systems. There are no less than six Performance Profiles included that you can choose from, depending on if you wish to play with BFCO, your desired performance target, or system specs (if not the Steam Deck):

**Emissaries of Tuxborn – Deck:** This profile aims for a locked 40FPS experience on the Steam Deck.

**Emissaries of Tuxborn – Deck CS:** This profile aims for a locked 30FPS experience on the Steam Deck, but with the additional visual benefits of the Community Shaders mod and profile.

**Emissaries of Tuxborn – Desktop:** This profile is for slightly more powerful PCs, has a full Community Shaders suite and higher INI settings. Performance of this profile will depend on your system specs.

**Emissaries of TuxBFCO – Deck:** This profile aims for a locked 40FPS experience on the Steam Deck, and includes the BFCO combat animation framework.

**Emissaries of TuxBFCO – Deck CS:** This profile aims for a locked 30FPS experience on the Steam Deck, but with the additional visual benefits of the Community Shaders mod and profile, and includes the BFCO combat animation framework.

**Emissaries of TuxBFCO – Desktop:** This profile is for slightly more powerful PCs, has a full Community Shaders suite, higher INI settings, and includes the BFCO combat animation framework. Performance of this profile will depend on your system specs.

Please Note: Due to the need for shader cache building on the Steam Deck, there may be a noticeable stutter in the first 1-2 hours while the cache builds. It should be good after that.

### <ins>Optional Mods</ins>

**Custom Presets Go in Here:** An empty folder to put any custom racemenu presets in (.jslot file format).

**SSE FPS Stabilizer:** A SKSE plugin that dynamically changes settings based on a performance target, can be disabled if you run into weird performance issues.

**Bigger HUD:** Makes the HUD bigger in scale for small screens.

**Skyrim Upscaler: DLSS FSR2 XeSS:** more FPS or longer battery life with the help of FSR upscaling.

**Masculine Animations for Female PCs/Feminine Animations for Male PCs:** changes some animations for the Player Character.

**Story Mode - not safesave:** Makes the game easier for those that want it, as Enderal is more changeling then default Skyrim. This will only work properly on a new save.

**Disabling Enderal Gameplay Overhaul:**
By default EGO is turned on and before you make any changes it’s highly recommended that you make a copy of the profile you want to use. You can do this by clicking on the ID card at the top of mo2 and then selecting your profile -> copy. What name you give it doesn’t matter. After that it’s just a case of selecting everything in EGO SE - Enderal Gameplay Overhaul (to disable turn-off everything in here) right clicking and selecting and you are ready to go. To be clear this isn’t SAFE SAVE and you will need a new save to do this.

**EGO Optionals:**
These go just above the bfco patch and below the EGO SE - Modded Moonsteel esp. 

**EGO SE - [NAME]:** Will change that setting back to what it was in Enderal with EGO

**Official EGO SE Hardcore Patches:** Will make the game even more changeling for those that have the will for it.

### <ins>Keybind Changes/Gamepad buttons</ins>

**Heromenu with gamepad/steamdeck:**
Heromenu is an important part of Enderal that you will need to map yourself. On the Steamdeck you should map the H key to a back button or a trackpad. For gamepad users you have two options. You can map it to Dpad Right a.k.a. the Hotkey or you can map it to select.

**BFCO**
There are a few changes to the keybinds/buttons in use with the BFCO-based Emissaries of Tux Profiles. The keybind/button changes are:
Controller
X = Dodge/Sprint
LB = Block with 1h+Spell
LT = Block everything else
RB = Heavy Attack
RT = Light Attack
L3 = Shout/Power
Dpad Left = Sheath Weapon
Dpad Down = Sneak

Keyboard
V = Block with 1h+Spell
Alt = Dodge/Sprint
G = Heavy Attack
M1 = Block everything else
M2 = Light Attack

(Keyboard users on the BFCO profile will need to select the Emissaries - BFCO Keyboard Input under optionals and disable Emissaries - BFCO Controller Input Input in MO2, we are still looking for the best key binds for this profile so feel free to say what you would want)

**RaceMenu Temporary Button Mapping - SteamDeck**
Unfortunately, due to a fight between SteamInput, RaceMenu and general Bethesda-ness, some gamepad buttons do not function as you will require, when using the BFCO profiles. Things like accessing the preset menu, or even just finishing and naming your character. To workaround this, you can temporarily map some additional buttons on the steam deck using the Steam menu. We suggest mapping the 'R' key, 'F5' and 'F9' keys to the back paddle buttons, this should work around the issues seen with RaceMenu on BFCO profiles for the Steam Deck. You can unmap the buttons once you've created the character. You might need to move around the trackpad mouse a bit for this to work.
