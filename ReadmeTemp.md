# Introduction


### <ins>About Tuxborn</ins>

Introducing **Tuxborn**, the first Wabbajack Modlist specifically designed from the ground up with the Steam Deck in mind!

The Modlist is currently in development, so support will be 'best effort' during this time. If you wish to chat about Tuxborn, join the [Aetherius Modding Discord](https://discord.gg/xRrHRsb5e9) , grab the Tuxborn role from Channels & Roles and look for us in the #txbn-general channel, support queries can be directed to #txbn-support. Or if you just want to chat about Wabbajack Modlists on Steam Deck/Linux in general, then drop by the #unofficial-linux-help channel of the [Official Wabbajack Discord](https://discord.gg/wabbajack).

Tuxborn was created to fill a gap in the Wabbajack Modlist landscape – A Modlist that specifically targets the performance profile of the Valve Steam Deck. While there are other Wabbajack Modlists that can be made to run on Steam Deck (a lot of our inspiration comes from the likes of Septimus, Redoran and Eldryn), most lists usually require some modification to get the performance or compatibility desired on the Steam Deck – With Tuxborn, the aim is to have that out of the box, with no additional modifications necessary.

Tuxborn supports only the Anniversary Edition of Skyrim on Steam, updated to **v1.6.1170**. You **must own Skyrim Anniversary Edition** to run Tuxborn.

### <ins>Performance</ins>

As noted above, Tuxborn is *designed* for the performance profile of the Steam Deck, but that doesn’t mean it’s limited to that platform! It’s also a great, content-full, lightweight (in terms of performance) list for less powerful systems. There are no less than six Performance Profiles included that you can choose from, depending on if you wish to play with BFCO,  your desired performance target, or system specs (if not the Steam Deck):

**Tuxborn – Deck:** This profile aims for a locked 40FPS experience on the Steam Deck.

**Tuxborn - Deck CS:** This profile aims for a locked 30FPS experience on the Steam Deck, but with the additional visual benefits of the Community Shaders mod and profile.

**Tuxborn – Desktop:** This profile is for slightly more powerful PCs, has a full Community Shaders suite and higher INI settings. Performance of this profile will depend on your system specs.

--

**Tuxborn – Deck BFCO:** This profile aims for a locked 40FPS experience on the Steam Deck, and includes the BFCO combat animation framework.

**Tuxborn - Deck CS BFCO:** This profile aims for a locked 30FPS experience on the Steam Deck, but with the additional visual benefits of the Community Shaders mod and profile, and includes the BFCO combat animation framework.

**Tuxborn – Desktop BFCO:** This profile is for slightly more powerful PCs, has a full Community Shaders suite, higher INI settings, and includes the BFCO combat animation framework. Performance of this profile will depend on your system specs.

Please Note: Due to the need for shader cache building on the Steam Deck, there may be a noticeable stutter in the first 1-2 hours while the cache builds. It should be good after that.


### <ins>Features</ins>

Tuxborn balances enhanced visuals with smooth performance, ensuring an immersive experience optimized for the Steam Deck's screen and resolution. Our curated selection of mods seamlessly integrates high-quality content, all while maintaining our commitment to keeping frame rates smooth.

Using the brilliant Anvil Modlist as a base, Tuxborn creates a balance of game fixes and QoL improvements, a carefully selected mix of Enairim and Simonrim gameplay changes, and a performance-focused selection of graphical enhancements across the board. Tuxborn includes the latest version of Legacy of the Dragonborn (v6), optional BFCO combat overhaul, a vast array of additional or overhauled quest content, NPC/Character Enhancements, Extra Weapons and Armours, Character Customisation options, Followers, and more!

Downloading a Wabbajack Modlist gives you everything you need - **you do not need to install ModOrganizer yourself, or copy mods to the Vanilla Skyrim directory, everything is already done for you!**. Use the ModOrganizer.exe file located in the Install Directory you select in Wabbajack to start and launch the modlist. On Stem Deck, the process is a little more involved, so see below for installation instructions.

A full list of mods included in the list can be found on the [Load Order Library](https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/tuxborn) page, but as a brief overview, Tuxborn utilises the following:

**Gameplay Changes (Simonrim):** [Blade and Blunt](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34549), [Mysticism](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27839), [Thaumaturgy](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57138), [Apothecary](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52130) & [Stormcrown](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/90659)

**Gameplay Changes (Enairim):** [Vokrii](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26176), [Mannaz](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/87219), [Freyr](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/88043), [Sacrilege](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42408), [Growl](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31245) & [Apocalypse](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1090)

**Gameplay Changes (Levelling):** Tuxborn utilises [Static Skill Levelling](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/89940) that changes the way levelling is handled. After gaining a level, you will be presented with a menu to select the skills you wish to level up. A better description can be found on the Nexus mod page, but essentially instead of gaining Skill XP as you use skills, you gain level XP. Once you level up and sleep, you can allocate points to the skills as you wish - no more min/max'ing, or casting the same spell over and over to level up a specific skill! Please note that this mod is optional and can be disabled *before* starting a new save. It *cannot be disabled mid-save*.

**Gameplay Changes (Combat):** Entirely optional, Tuxborn includes three performance profiles that includes the [BFCO - Attack Behavior Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/117052) bringing modern combat animations and features to Skyrim, including new animations for melee/range weapons, while also  allowing attacks while jumping and swimming.

**Visual Enhancements:** [Skyrim AIO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34179), [Obsidian Weather and Seasons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12125), [Happy Little Trees](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50961), [Community Shaders](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/86492) (CS and Desktop Profiles).

**NPC Changes:** We have been careful to enhance the visuals for NPCs throughout the game world, without going for the "supermodels everywhere" look.

**Content:** Tuxborn aims to include as much of the good quality quest content and enhancements, including (but not limited to) [Legacy of the Dragonborn (v6)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11802), [JaySerpa Quest Expansion Series](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/jayserpa/mods?gameId=1704), [Beyond Skyrim - Bruma](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10917), [Byeond Reach](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3008), [Vigilant](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11849), [Glenmoril](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32998), [Unslaad](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11789), [The Grey Cowl of Nocturnal](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4509), [Falskaar](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2057), [Wyrmstooth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45565), [Midwood Isle](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28120), [Moonpath to Elsweyr](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4341/) plus a whole load of smaller quest mods!

**Miscellaneous changes:**

**Survival:** We've included the Survival Overhaul [Starfrost](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/97536) for those that enjoy the survival gameplay. While not enabled by default, it can be turned on by following the [same steps](https://help.bethesda.net/#en/answer/39919) as enabling Survival mode in Vanilla Skyrim. You can toggle the ability to fast-travel by editing the mod's ini file. More details can be found on the Starfrost Nexus page.

Tuxborn includes the [Pronouns](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43816) mod, allowing you to select your preferred pronouns. As per the mod page details

_Selecting they/them pronouns could prevent you from completing certain quests that don't provide gender-neutral dialogue alternatives. To combat this issue, I've developed the Pronouns Patcher, which allows They/Them players to default to fallback pronouns in those cases. Run the Pronouns Patcher via xEdit, then set your fallback pronouns in the MCM._

We've done the xEdit bit for you, but you will still have to set your fallback pronoun via the MCM in-game.

**Optional Mods:**

# Installation

For best results, you should consider fully uninstalling and reinstalling Skyrim from your Windows system prior to installing the Modlist via Wabbajack. This will ensure that there are no additional, unneeded or unclean files that could interrupt or make the Wabbajack installation process fail.

For the actual modlist install, it is strongly recommended that you have a Nexus Premium account, otherwise you will need to manually download each of the mods, when prompted by Wabbajack.

For both the installation via Wabbajack and playing the modlist (either on Windows or on Steam Deck/Linux), **you will need to have launched Vanilla Skyrim at least once, and have downloaded all the Anniversary Edition Creation Club content from within Skyrim.** Failure to do so may result in the modlist install failing, especially due to the mismatch of Curios naming versions.

Downloads for Tuxborn are currently ~112GB, and the resulting modlist install size on disk is ~176GB. Wabbajack lists generally advise having an aditional 40GB of space available for temporary files that will be removed after the install process, so **you will need at least a total of 330GB** free disk space on your Windows system to download and install Tuxborn. If you are transferring and playing on Steam Deck, you do not need to transfer the Downloads directory, only the Install directory, so you will need at least 176GB of free space on the Steam Deck or SD Card. 

### <ins>Wabbajack</ins>

As it stands, the Wabbajack application must be **installed and run** on a Windows system, it cannot be installed on Steam Deck/Linux directly.

On your Windows system, install [Visual C++ x64](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) & [.Net Runtime v5desktop x64](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0/runtime) – these are required to run Wabbajack.

Download the Wabbajack application from [here](https://www.wabbajack.org/) and place it in a folder such as C:\Games\Wabbajack – Do not place it in Program Files, Downloads, or on your Desktop.

Download the .wabbajack file from the [Tuxborn Nexusmods Page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/114206?tab=files). This will download a 7zip file archive with the .wabbajack file contained within. Extract it somewhere easily accessible.

Open Wabbajack, and click the “Install from Disk” option.

<img src="https://github.com/Omni-guides/Tuxborn/blob/main/images/Tuxborn_FromDisk.png" width="400">

Browse to where you downloaded and extracted the Tuxborn.wabbajack file, select it, and click OK.

Enter the details for where you want to store the Modlist Installation and Downloads directories - do not select a directory in Downloads, Program Files or on the Desktop - use something like C:\Games\Tuxborn instead.

Click the Cog icon in the top-right of Wabbajack, then 'login' next to the Nexus Mods button and enter your Nexusmods account details.

Once ready, click the Play button in Wabbajack to begin the Wabbajack process.

<img src="https://github.com/Omni-guides/Tuxborn/blob/main/images/Tuxborn_WJReady.png" width="400">

Downloading any Wabbajack Modlist can take a while - how quickly it completes will depend on the speed of your internet connection and processing power of your PC.

If you are going to be playing on a Windows system, you can skip ahead to [Starting the Game](https://github.com/Omni-guides/Tuxborn#starting-the-game).


### <ins>Steam Deck/Linux</ins>

Once the Wabbajack download and install process has completed successfully in Wabbajack, you will need to transfer the data to your Steam Deck or Linux system. There are a number of ways to do this, some graphical and some command line. [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=how+to+transfer+files+to+steam+deck) has a number of guides on the various options.

After transferring the data to the Steam Deck, follow the few steps [here](https://github.com/Omni-guides/Wabbajack-Modlist-Linux/wiki/Using-the-omni%E2%80%90guides.sh-Automation-Script) that will configure most things for you automatically by running the automated install script.

(Alternatively) If you prefer, you can manually configure the Modlist on Steam Deck/Linux by following the steps in the manual Tuxborn guide, [here](https://github.com/Omni-guides/Wabbajack-Modlist-Linux/wiki/Skyrim:-Tuxborn).

If you are running on a Steam Deck, whether you use the automated install script or the manual guide, you *MUST* apply the recommended CryoUtilities changes, as described in [Step 5](https://github.com/Omni-guides/Wabbajack-Modlist-Linux/wiki/Skyrim:-Tuxborn#step-8---cryoutilities-changes-steam-deck-only-required) of the Tuxborn install guide.

⚠️ ❗ UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCESPRESS THE “UNLOCK” BUTTON WHEN YOU HAVE LOADED SOMETHING THROUGH MOD-ORGANIZER.
YOU WILL BREAK MANY MANY THINGS. DO NOT PRESS THE BUTTON! ⚠️ ❗


### <ins>In-Game</ins>

Tuxborn makes use of the [Alternate Start - Life another life SSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/272) mod - this allows you to select an alternative location or settings to start your journey. We have deliberately removed some of the alternate start options as they proved to be buggy or cause issues further into a save.

After making your Character, PLEASE WAIT until there are no longer any notification messages show in the top-left of the screen.

<img src="https://github.com/Omni-guides/Tuxborn/blob/main/images/Tuxborn_In-gameNotifications.png" width="400">

When no more messages are displayed, speak to the statue and select your Alternative Startm then sleep in the bed as directed to being your adventure!

There are no MCM options that **need** to be altered before you start playing. If desired however, you can load the included SmoothCam Preset.

<img src="https://github.com/Omni-guides/Tuxborn/blob/main/images/Tuxborn_SmoothCamPreset.png" width="400">

**Gallows Hall:** Level 35

If the mod/quest isn't listed above, please check the orginal mods page for how to start it, or what the requirements are.


### <ins>Other Information</ins>

⚠️ ❗ **Photo Mode:** We've included [PhotoMode](), but unfortunately the button mapping for controlling it is very troublesome on gamepad/deck on the BFCO profiles - you can end up with the camera a bit stuck. To get out of this stuck camera, you need to run "tfc" twice in the in-game console. Unfortunately, this does not work on Steam Deck. Thanks to Todd for that one. ⚠️ ❗

Steam Deck Specific:

Updating the Modlist - Our recommended method is coming soon.

Boot Time of the game - Modded Skyrim can take an awfully long time to boot on Steam Deck. Even more when you have so uch content as Tuxborn, and have so many methods applied to try and squeeze out every FPS we can. Timing on ht original LCD Steam Deck, it takes XXXXX to fully load the game to the main menu. Sadly there is no way to bring this down, but is part of the cost of having so many mods included in the list.
