# Introduction

### <ins>About Tuxborn</ins>

Introducing **Tuxborn**, a Performance & Content-focused Wabbajack Modlist, with profiles tailored for both handheld devices and Laptops/Desktop PCs.

If you need support or wish to chat about Tuxborn, join the [Aetherius Modding Discord](https://discord.gg/xRrHRsb5e9), grab the Tuxborn role from Channels & Roles and look for us in the #txbn-general channel - support queries can be directed to the #txbn-support discord forum. Or if you just want to chat about Wabbajack Modlists on Steam Deck/Linux in general, then drop by the #unofficial-linux-help channel of the [Official Wabbajack Discord](https://discord.gg/wabbajack).

Inspired by the likes of Septimus, Eldryn and Redoran, Tuxborn was initially created to fill a gap in the Wabbajack Modlist landscape – A Modlist that at a minimum targets the performance profile of the Valve Steam Deck, and midrange PCs on the higher end. Since inception, Tuxborn has evolved to become a great option for those using less powerful PCs or laptops, as well as the full range of handheld PCs that are now on the market. <ins>With options for both regulare skyrim combat and moderne 3rd person action combat based on MCO, using a combination of Simonrim and Enairim overhauls. Enhanced by new perk trees, statice leveling and a large amount of new content to play.</ins> (enough or does more need to be added).  

Tuxborn supports only the Anniversary Edition of Skyrim on Steam, updated to **v1.6.1170**. You **must own Skyrim Anniversary Edition** to run Tuxborn, and the language **must be set to English**. Your CPU must support AVX, which should be fine for most CPUs newer than 2011.
