# Introduction

### About Tuxborn

Introducing **Tuxborn**, the first Wabbajack Modlist specifically designed from the ground up with the Steam Deck in mind, and inspired by the likes of Septimus, Redoran and Eldryn.

The Modlist currently in an early Alpha Stage, so support will be minimal at best during this time while we develop the Modlist. If you wish to chat about Tuxborn, or Wabbajack Modlists on Steam Deck/Linux in general, then drop by the #unofficial-linux-help channel of the Official Wabbajack Discord.

Tuxborn was created to fill a gap in the Wabbajack Modlist landscape – A Modlist that specifically targets the Performance Profile of the Valve Steam Deck. While there are other Wabbajack Modlists that can be made to run on Steam Deck, they usually require some modification to get the performance or compatibility desired – With Tuxborn, the aim is to have that out of the box, with no additional modifications necessary.

Tuxborn supports only the Anniversary Edition of Skyrim, updated to **v1.6.1170**. Anniversary Edition is **not optional**.

### Features

Tuxborn balances enhanced visuals with smooth performance, ensuring an immersive experience optimized for the Steam Deck's screen and resolution. Our curated selection of mods seamlessly integrates high-quality content, all while maintaining our commitment to keeping frame rates smooth.

Using the brilliant Anvil Modlist as a base, Tuxborn creates a balance of game fixes and QoL improvements, a carefully selected mix of Enairim and Simonrim
gameplay changes, and a performance-focused selection of graphical enhancements across the board. 

As we work through the development of Tuxborn, future versions will include Additional or Overhauled Quest Content, NPC/Character Enhancements, Extra Weapons and Armours, and more!

Downloading a Wabbajack Modlist gives you everything you need - **you do not need to install ModOrganizer yourself, or copy mods to the Vanilla Skyrim directory, everything is already done for you!**
 

The current Loadorder Library can be found here: [Tuxborn](https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/tuxborn)

### Performance

As noted, this Modlist is designed for the performance profile of the Steam Deck, but that doesn’t mean it’s limited to that platform! It’s also a great, lightweight list for less powerful systems. There are three Profiles included that you can choose from depending on your performance desire, or system used (if not the Steam Deck):
 
Tuxborn – Deck: This profile aims for a locked 40FPS experience on the Steam Deck
Tuxborn - Deck CS: This profile aims for a locked 30FPS experience on the Steam Deck, but with the additional visual benefits of the Community Shaders mod and profile.
Tuxborn – Desktop: This profile is for slightly more powerful PCs, has a full Community Shaders suite, higher INI settings, and uses Azurite Weathers instead of Cathedral Weathers. Performance of this profile will depend on your system specs.

Please Note: Due to the need for shader cache building on the Steam Deck, there may be a noticeable stutter in the first 1-2 hours while the cache builds. It should be good after that.

# Installation

For best results, you should consider fully uninstalling and reinstalling Skyrim from your Windows system prior to installing the Modlist. This will ensure that there are no additional, unneeded or unclean files that could interrupt or make the Wabbajack installation process fail.

It is strongly recommended that you have a Nexus Premium account, otherwise you will need to manually download each of the mods, when prompted by Wabbajack.

### Wabbajack

As it stands, the Wabbajack application must be Installed and run on a Windows system, it cannot be installed on Steam Deck/Linux directly.

On your Windows system, install [Visual C++ x64](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) & [.Net Runtime v5desktop x64](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0/runtime) – these are required to run Wabbajack.

Download the Wabbajack application from [here](https://www.wabbajack.org/) and place it in a folder such as C:\Games\Wabbajack – Do not place it in Program Files, Downloads, or on your Desktop.

Download the .wabbajack file from the [Tuxborn Nexusmods Page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/114206?tab=description). This will download a 7zip file archive with the .wabbajack file contained within.

Open Wabbajack, and click the “Install from Disk” option.

<img src="https://github.com/Omni-guides/Wabbajack-Modlist-Linux/blob/main/images/TuxbornNexus/TuxbornNexus_FromDisk.png?raw=true" width="400">

Browse to where you downloaded and extracted the Tuxborn.wabbajack file, select it, and click OK.

Enter the details for where you want to store the Modlist Installation and Downloads directories, do not select a directory in Downloads, Program Files or on the Desktop - use something like C:\Games\Tuxborn instead.

Click the Cog icon in the top-right of Wabbajack, then 'login' next to the Nexus Mods button and enter your Nexusmods account details.

Once ready, click the Play button in Wabbajack to begin the Wabbajack process.

Downloading any Wabbajack Modlist can take a while - how quickly it completes will depend on the speed of your internet connection and processing power of your PC.

If you are going to be playing on a Windows system, you can skip ahead to Starting the Game.

### Steam Deck/Linux

Once the Wabbajack download and install process has completed successfully in Wabbajack, you will need to transfer the data to your Steam Deck or Linux system. There are a number of ways to do this – you can see a few options on the Omni-Guides Github here <To Insert link to transfer guide>.

After transferring the data to the Steam Deck, follow the few steps [here](https://github.com/Omni-guides/Wabbajack-Modlist-Linux/wiki/Using-the-omni%E2%80%90guides.sh-Automation-Script) that will configure things for you automatically by running the automated install script.

(Alternatively) If you prefer, you can manually configure the Modlist on Steam Deck/Linux by following the steps in the manual Tuxborn guide, [here](https://github.com/Omni-guides/Wabbajack-Modlist-Linux/wiki/Skyrim:-Tuxborn).

Explore the room and read the note on the table before you leave by activating the button behind the table, or by talking to the dragon to select your alternate start.

There are no MCM options that need to be altered before you start playing. If desired however, you can load the included SmoothCam Preset.

### Updating the Modlist

Before updating please backup your saves and CharGen presets, just in case. Repeat the same steps with Wabbajack from the Installation section, but make sure you toggle on the “Overwrite Existing Modlist” checkboxin the bottom right.

<img src="https://github.com/Omni-guides/Wabbajack-Modlist-Linux/blob/main/images/TuxbornNexus/TuxbornNexus_WJOverwrite.png?raw=true﻿" width="400">


Unless otherwise stated, generally Modlist version 0.0.X updates are save-safe, any others are not.
